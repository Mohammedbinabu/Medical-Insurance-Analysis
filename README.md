# Insurance Charges Based on Patient Health Metrics

This project aims to delve deep into the art of data storytelling. It focuses on the analysis of factors affecting insurance charges based on individual patientsâ€™ health backgrounds.
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the power of data storytelling in extracting meaningful information from raw data and using that information to make informed decisions.

I have used machine learning techniques to identify patterns and create cluster representations that influence the target variable.

## Importing Dataset:

- Imported a dataset containing information about patientsâ€™ health backgrounds, such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:

- The distribution of sexes in the dataset is analyzed to understand the proportion of males and females.
- The analysis of the distribution of age categories in the dataset is being conducted to understand the age demographics of the population under study
- The distribution of Body Mass Index (BMI) values in the dataset to examin and understand the health status of the population.
- The distribution of patients by the number of children they have to understand the demographics of the patient population in terms of family size.
- Smoking habits among the patient
- BMI Distribution among Smokers Status across Different Age Groups
- Gender-Based Distribution of Average Insurance Charges
- Comparison of Insurance Charges by Sex
- Average charges for different age categories/Gropus
- Impact of Age on Charges
- Insurance Charges vs. Number of Children per Patient
- The average fees associated with the number of children each patient 
-  relationship between weight status, as indicated by BMI categories, and charges
- Cost Analysis of Obese Individuals Segmented by Smoking Habits
- In-depth Analysis of Obesity in Relation to Smoking Habits
- Comparison of Patient's Charges vs. Age for Smokers and Non-Smokers
- Distribution of Charges vs Age Category for Smokers and Non-Smokers in region
## Statistical Analysis:
- ANOVA test on independent variables.
## Unsupervised Learning:
- Performing Clustering Manually
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
